# Secure Connect Manager Library Documentation

## Overview

`Secure Connect Manager` is a sophisticated library crafted for managing WebSocket connections and server discovery in JavaScript applications. It excels in seamlessly connecting to servers, maintaining active connections, and dynamically discovering new servers.

## Installation

Install the `Secure Connect Manager` library in your project using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm i @galacfetch/secure-connect-manager
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @galacfetch/secure-connect-manager
```

## Initialization

To use `Secure Connect Manager`, initialize the connection manager with your API endpoint and desired discovery interval:

```tsx
import { secureConnectManager } from '@galacfetch/secure-connect-manager'

secureConnectManager.init({
  api: 'yourApiEndpoint',
  discoveryInterval: 60000,
})
```

This configures the manager for your API endpoint with a 60-second discovery interval.

## Basic Usage

### Connecting to WebSocket Servers

Initiate a connection to a WebSocket server:

```tsx
await secureConnectManager.connectToSocket('serverUrl', 'apiToken')
```

### Server Discovery

Automatically discover and connect to new servers:

```tsx
secureConnectManager.init({
  api: 'yourApiEndpoint',
  discoveryInterval: 60000,
})
```

The manager routinely checks for and connects to new servers.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Configuration

Customize the discovery interval and API endpoint:

```tsx
secureConnectManager.init({
  api: 'yourNewApiEndpoint',
  discoveryInterval: 30000,
})
```

Set a new API endpoint and adjust the discovery interval to 30 seconds.

## Types

`Secure Connect Manager` leverages TypeScript for enhanced code management and error handling:

- `TSecureConnectManager`: Primary manager type.
- `TConfig`: Configuration type.

## Examples

### Initializing and Managing Connections

Example React component for initializing and managing WebSocket connections:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { secureConnectManager } from '@galacfetch/secure-connect-manager'

const ConnectionManager: React.FC = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    secureConnectManager.init({
      api: 'yourApiEndpoint',
      discoveryInterval: 60000,
    })

    // Additional logic for connection handling
  }, [])

  return <div>Connection Manager Initialized</div>
}

export default ConnectionManager
```
