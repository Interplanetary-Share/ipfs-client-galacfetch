## An IPFS Client Hook to connect to galacfetch IPFS nodes

This hook is used to manage files on the IPFS network using the galacfetch IPFS nodes and as a Gateway.

### Component usage

In this example, we use ipfsGalactFetchClient hook that interact with useLocalIpfsStore and useRemoteIpfsStore hooks to manage files on the IPFS network.

This is the Main hook

```js
const { status, init, getFile, getFiles, uploadFile, urlFileList } =
  ipfsGalactFetchClient();
```

You can also interact with the other 2 hooks directly if you want to use them separately.

```js
const { ipfs
        initIpfs
        localCheckIsFile
        localGetFile
        localAddFile
        localRemoveFile
        localGetAllFiles } = useLocalIpfsStore();

const { servers
        init
        addNewBlobUrl
        api
        remoteCheckIntegrityFile
        remoteGetFileInfo
        remoteGetFilesInfo
        remoteGetFile
        remoteUploadFile
        remoteRestoreIntegrityFile
        remotegetFileExtraProps } = useRemoteIpfsStore();

```

## ipfsGalactFetchClient hook

First we initialize the hook by calling the init function.
This will connect to the IPFS galacfetch nodes and you will get access to your files through your api.

The init function expect 2 props to be passed to it. api and repoName.

The api is the token that you get from galacfetch.
You can get a free API here. https://galacfetch.com/

The repoName is the name of the repo that you want to use to store your files. You can use the same repoName for multiple projects or change the repo based in environment.

```js
const api = 'ABC123';
const repoName = 'ExampleRepoName';
useEffect(() => {
  init(api, repoName);
}, []);
```

After initialize, the status will be set to iddle. and you can start using the hook.

### status

the status is an object that contains the status of the hook.

```js
{
  status: 'idle' | 'loading' | undefined;
}
```

### init

After call the init function we initialized properly the hook and we can start using it.

```js
const { status, init } = ipfsGalactFetchClient();
const api = 'ABC123';
const repoName = 'ExampleRepoName';
useEffect(() => {
  init(api, repoName);
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  if (status === 'idle') {
    console.log('Ready to rock!');
  }
  if (status === 'loading') {
    console.log('loading');
  }
}, [status]);
```

### getFile

the getFile function is used to get a file from the IPFS network. expect 2 props to be passed to it. CID, and the config object.

```js
const { getFile } = ipfsGalactFetchClient();
export interface getFileConfig {
  showBlobUrl?: boolean;
  showInfoFile?: boolean;
  showExtraProps?: boolean;
}
const config: getFileConfig = {
  showBlobUrl: true,
  showInfoFile: true,
  showExtraProps: true,
};
// By default all the props are set to true.

const fileInfo = await getFile(cid, config);
```

### getFiles

the getFiles function is used to get a list of files from the IPFS network.

Expect 3 props to be passed to it. the `isPublic` scope, the configProps, and the filter/sort/page params, all optionals.

Basic example of use:

```js
const { getFiles } = ipfsGalactFetchClient();
const isPublic = false;
const config = {
  showBlobUrl: true,
  showInfoFile: true,
  showExtraProps: true,
};
copnst queryParams = {
  page:1,
  size:10,
  sort: { createdAt: -1 },
}

await getFiles(isPublic, config, queryParams);
```

There are 2 scopes

#### isPublic true vs isPublic false

the `isPublic` props of the files, by default is false, meaning you will get your files from your api token.

if you want to get the public files from the galacfetch network you need to set public to true,
meaning you will get the files that the `isPublic` is set to true.

```js
public?: boolean; // default false
```

#### configProps

same as getFile method above. optional, and all props are set to true by default.

```js
export interface getFileConfig {
  showBlobUrl?: boolean;
  showInfoFile?: boolean;
  showExtraProps?: boolean;
}
```

#### queryParams (Optional)

page, size, filter, sort.

```js
export interface queryParams {
  page?: number;
  size?: number;
  filter?: object | undefined;
  sort?: object | undefined;
}
```

##### page

page: number - The page number that you want to get. Default 1

##### size

size: number - The number of files per page. Default 10

##### filter

filter: object - The filter that you want to apply to the files, default undefined.

The filter obeys to query selectors https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/

```js
// filter by name
{
  name: "fileName";
}

// search by name
{
  name: { $regex: "fileName", $options: "i" };
}


// filter by extra properties, example searching in  array of string "test2" and using regex to search in ownerID
{
  extraProperties: {
    likes:"test2", // search in array of string "test2"
    ownerID: {"$regex":"me","$options":"i" }  // search in ownerID using regex
    }
}
```

sort: object - The sort that you want to apply to the files. Default undefined
the sort obeys to cursor sort of mongo https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/reference/method/cursor.sort/#mongodb-method-cursor.sort

```js
// date descending sort from newest to oldest
{
  createdAt: -1;
}
// date ascending sort from oldest to newest
{
  createdAt: 1;
}
```

### uploadFile

the uploadFile function is used to upload a file to the IPFS network. expect 3 props to be passed to it. file, fileProps, and an optional serverAlias

```js
const { uploadFile } = ipfsGalactFetchClient();

await uploadFile(file, fileProps, serverAlias);
```

Basic Example of upload file

```js
const uploadConfig = {name:"fileNameTest",description:"DescriptionTest",extraProperties:{"likes":["test2","another"],"ownerID":"me"}}
<input
  type="file"
  onChange={(e) => {
    if (!e.target.files) return console.log('error no file selected');
    const file = e.target.files[0];
    uploadFile(file, uploadConfig);
  }}
/>
```

#### FileProps (UploadConfig)

```js
export type FileProps = {
  name: string,
  description: string,
  extraProperties?: Object,
  isPublic?: boolean,
};
```

The config object has the name, description and extraProperties props.

the extraProperties is an object that can contain any extra properties you want to add to the file, for example tags, likes, ownerID, attachments, etc. You can add anything while it is in JSON format.

the isPublic is a boolean that by default is set to false. If you set it to true, the file will be uploaded and be visible in public scope to anyone, for example when we getfiles with public scope.

The serverAlias is optional. If you don't pass it, the file will be uploaded to the best server available.
In case you want to upload the file to a specific server, you can pass the serverAlias to the function.

#### serverAlias

The serverAlias that you have access can be found in your dashboard. https://galacfetch.com/ and is determined by the token you are using.

### urlFileList

the hook preload the files in memory and in a local IPFS node to save bandwidth and improve performance. The urlFileList function is used to get the list of files that are in memory and in the local IPFS node.
the urlFileList is an array of UrlFileList interface

This hook is mainly used internally to avoid downloading the same file multiple times.

```js
UrlFileList {
  url: string;
  cid: string;
}
```

Example

```js
const { urlFileList } = ipfsGalactFetchClient();

return (
     <h4>Preloaded Files</h4>
        {urlFileList.map((urlFile,idx) => {
          return (
              <div key={idx}>
              blobUrl: {urlFile.url} <br>
              cid: {urlFile.cid}
            </div>
          );
        })}
)
```
