# Secure Connect Manager Library Documentation

## Overview

`Secure Connect Manager` is a robust library designed to manage WebSocket connections and server discovery in JavaScript applications. It provides a straightforward and efficient API for connecting to servers, handling active connections, and automatically discovering new servers.

## Installation

To install the `Secure Connect Manager` library, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm i @intershare/hooks.secure-connect-manager
```

Or, if you are using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add @intershare/hooks.secure-connect-manager
```

## Initialization

Before using `Secure Connect Manager`, you need to initialize the connection manager. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
import { secureConnectManager } from '@intershare/hooks.secure-connect-manager'

secureConnectManager.init({
  api: 'yourApiEndpoint',
  discoveryInterval: 60000,
})
```

This will set up the connection manager with your API endpoint and a discovery interval of 60 seconds.

## Basic Usage

### Connecting to WebSocket

To connect to a WebSocket server:

```tsx
await secureConnectManager.connectToSocket('serverUrl', 'apiToken')
```

### Server Discovery

To automatically discover and connect to new servers:

```tsx
secureConnectManager.init({
  api: 'yourApiEndpoint',
  discoveryInterval: 60000,
})
```

The manager will periodically check for new servers and establish connections.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the discovery interval and API endpoint:

```tsx
secureConnectManager.init({
  api: 'yourNewApiEndpoint',
  discoveryInterval: 30000, // Interval in milliseconds
})
```

This sets a new API endpoint and changes the discovery interval to 30 seconds.

## Types

`Secure Connect Manager` uses several TypeScript types for better code management and error handling:

- `TSecureConnectManager`: Main manager type.
- `TConfig`: Configuration type for the manager.

## Examples

### Initializing and Managing Connections

```tsx
// Example component to initialize and manage WebSocket connections
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { secureConnectManager } from '@intershare/hooks.secure-connect-manager'

const ConnectionManager: React.FC = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    secureConnectManager.init({
      api: 'yourApiEndpoint',
      discoveryInterval: 60000,
    })

    // Additional logic to handle connections
  }, [])

  return <div>Connection Manager Initialized</div>
}

export default ConnectionManager
```
