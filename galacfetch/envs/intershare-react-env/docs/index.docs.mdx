## Description

**Intershare React Environment** is a custom development environment for React, derived from the popular [React Environment by TeamBit](https://bit.cloud/teambit/react/react-env). This fork has been modified and optimized to enhance collaboration and efficiency in React projects.

## Features

This environment allows for advanced management of React components, offering features such as automatic updates and efficient dependency handling.

### Environment Usage

To use this environment in your project, configure it like this example:

```sh
bit env set utils/general envs/intershare-react-env
```

Here `utils/general` is the `scope (utils)` and `component name (geneal)` and `env/intershare-react-env` is the scope and name of the environment.

### Components Update

To update your components to the latest available version, use the following command:

```sh
bit envs update
```

This command ensures that all components are synchronized with the latest updates of the environment.

### Testing

You can easily test all components using:

```sh
bit test
```

This command runs tests on all components to ensure their proper functioning.

### Dependency Management

In case of missing dependencies, the environment can be configured to install them automatically:

```sh
bit install --add-missing-deps
```

This command searches for and adds any missing dependencies. If you encounter an error related to `@teambit/react.react-env/config/tsconfig.json`, try running the command again, as it may fail on the first installation.
